âš  Project abandoned until further notice!

# Rosemary Project
An implementation of [Hitogata](https://sites.google.com/site/vhitogata/), a VTubing software for Android and Desktop.

Implementation will use a virtual camera instead of a window, on both iOS, Android, and Desktop. 

It should also be possible to export to anything that uses the VTubing software on iOS, that's used by VTube Studio. Including but also not limited to physically exporting face tracking points,
