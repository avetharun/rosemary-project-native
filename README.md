# Rosemary Project
An implementation of [Hitogata](https://sites.google.com/site/vhitogata/), a VTubing software for Android and Desktop.

Implementation will use a virtual camera instead of a window, on both iOS, Android, and Desktop. 

Should also be able to output raw stream into a http webpage, to fetch via a web element (ie, in OBS)

Usages of this software & backend code: UI scene creation, and a basic scripting language
